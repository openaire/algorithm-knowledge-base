                <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="citation-count-cc">Citation Count (CC)</h2>
<p>This is the most widely used scientific impact indicator, which sums all citations received by each article. The citation count of a 
publication <span class="arithmatex">\(i\)</span> corresponds to the in-degree of the corresponding node in the underlying citation network: <span class="arithmatex">\(s_i = \sum_{j} A_{i,j}\)</span>, 
where <span class="arithmatex">\(A\)</span> is the adjacency matrix of the network (i.e., <span class="arithmatex">\(A_{i,j}=1\)</span> when paper <span class="arithmatex">\(j\)</span> cites paper <span class="arithmatex">\(i\)</span>, while <span class="arithmatex">\(A_{i,j}=0\)</span> otherwise). 
Citation count can be viewed as a measure of a publication's overall impact, since it conveys the number of other works that directly 
drew on it.</p>
<h2 id="incubation-citation-count-icc">"Incubation" Citation Count (iCC)</h2>
<p>This measure is essentially a time-restricted version of the citation count, where the time window is distinct for each paper, i.e., 
only citations <span class="arithmatex">\(y\)</span> years after its publication are counted (usually, <span class="arithmatex">\(y=3\)</span>). The ``incubation'' citation count of a paper <span class="arithmatex">\(i\)</span> is 
calculated as: <span class="arithmatex">\(s_i = \sum_{j,t_j \leq t_i+3} A_{i,j}\)</span>, where <span class="arithmatex">\(A\)</span> is the adjacency matrix and <span class="arithmatex">\(t_j, t_i\)</span> are the citing and cited paper's 
publication years, respectively. <span class="arithmatex">\(t_i\)</span> is cited paper <span class="arithmatex">\(i\)</span>'s publication year. iCC can be seen as an indicator of a paper's initial momentum 
(impulse) directly after its publication.</p>
<h2 id="pagerank-pr">PageRank (PR)</h2>
<p>Originally developed to rank Web pages, PageRank has been also widely used to rank publications in citation
networks. In this latter context, a publication's PageRank 
score also serves as a measure of its influence. In particular, the PageRank score of a publication is calculated 
as its probability of being read by a researcher that either randomly selects publications to read or selects 
publications based on the references of her latest read. Formally, the score of a publication <span class="arithmatex">\(i\)</span> is given by: </p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
s_i = \alpha \cdot \sum_{j} P_{i,j} \cdot s_j + (1-\alpha) \cdot \frac{1}{N}
\]</div>
<p>where <span class="arithmatex">\(P\)</span> is the stochastic transition matrix, which corresponds to the column normalised version of adjacency 
matrix <span class="arithmatex">\(A\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(\alpha \in [0,1]\)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\(N\)</span> is the number of publications in the citation network. The first addend 
of the equation corresponds to the selection (with probability <span class="arithmatex">\(\alpha\)</span>) of following a reference, while the 
second one to the selection of randomly choosing any publication in the network. It should be noted that the 
score of each publication relies of the score of publications citing it (the algorithm is executed iteratively 
until all scores converge). As a result, PageRank differentiates citations based on the importance of citing 
articles, thus alleviating the corresponding issue of the Citation Count.</p>
<h2 id="ram">RAM</h2>
<p>RAM is essentially a modified Citation Count, where recent citations are considered of higher importance compared 
to older ones. Hence, it better captures the popularity of publications. This "time-awareness" of citations 
alleviates the bias of methods like Citation Count and PageRank against recently published articles, which have 
not had "enough" time to gather as many citations. The RAM score of each paper <span class="arithmatex">\(i\)</span> is calculated as follows:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
s_i = \sum_j{R_{i,j}}
\]</div>
<p>where <span class="arithmatex">\(R\)</span> is the so-called Retained Adjacency Matrix (RAM) and <span class="arithmatex">\(R_{i,j}=\gamma^{t_c-t_j}\)</span> when publication <span class="arithmatex">\(j\)</span> cites publication 
<span class="arithmatex">\(i\)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\(R_{i,j}=0\)</span> otherwise. Parameter <span class="arithmatex">\(\gamma \in (0,1)\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(t_c\)</span> corresponds to the current year and <span class="arithmatex">\(t_j\)</span> corresponds to the 
publication year of citing article <span class="arithmatex">\(j\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="attrank">AttRank</h2>
<p>AttRank is a PageRank variant that alleviates its bias against recent publications (i.e., it is tailored to capture popularity). 
AttRank achieves this by modifying PageRank's probability of randomly selecting a publication. Instead of using a uniform probability,
AttRank defines it based on a combination of the publication's age and the citations it received in recent years. The AttRank score 
of each publication <span class="arithmatex">\(i\)</span> is calculated based on:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
s_i = \alpha \cdot \sum_{j} P_{i,j} \cdot s_j
    + \beta \cdot Att(i)+ \gamma \cdot c \cdot e^{-\rho \cdot (t_c-t_i)}
\]</div>
<p>where <span class="arithmatex">\(\alpha + \beta + \gamma =1\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(\alpha,\beta,\gamma \in [0,1]\)</span>. <span class="arithmatex">\(Att(i)\)</span> denotes a recent attention-based score for publication <span class="arithmatex">\(i\)</span>, 
which reflects its share of citations in the <span class="arithmatex">\(y\)</span> most recent years, <span class="arithmatex">\(t_i\)</span> is the publication year of article <span class="arithmatex">\(i\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(t_c\)</span> denotes the current 
year, and <span class="arithmatex">\(c\)</span> is a normalisation constant. Finally, <span class="arithmatex">\(P\)</span> is the stochastic transition matrix.</p>
